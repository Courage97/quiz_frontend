The Interview Quiz Platform (Frontend) is a modern, interactive web application that enables hosts to conduct real-time quiz sessions with multiple participants. Built using Next.js, it offers a seamless and responsive experience for both hosts and quiz participants. Hosts can create quizzes, launch live sessions, and push questions to connected players. Participants join using a session code and receive each question instantly through a WebSocket connection, allowing them to answer within a timed window.

The platform emphasizes simplicity and engagement. Participants get instant feedback on their answers, and once the session ends, they’re shown a personal result page along with a leaderboard of top scorers. Meanwhile, hosts are redirected to a session summary page where they can view participant scores and read feedback submitted anonymously. The design prioritizes accessibility for all users, making it ideal for virtual classrooms, team-building activities, or candidate assessments.

Security and control are also well considered—hosts must log in using a secure token-based system (JWT), ensuring only authorized users can manage quizzes and view results. The frontend communicates efficiently with the backend APIs to manage state and data, and uses real-time WebSocket channels to keep all participants in sync without page reloads.

This project is not only technically robust but also user-friendly and highly engaging, making it an excellent addition to your portfolio and a valuable tool for live quiz hosting in various contexts.
